{"name":"Jquery.fullscreenbg.js","body":"jquery.fullscreenbg.js\r\n======================\r\n\r\nA lightweight plugin for jQuery to support an automatically-resized\r\nfull-screen or full-width background image on a web page.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n*Author*: Michael Hucka (http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~mhucka) based on code\r\nby Jan Schneiders (http://nanotux.com).  See the bottom of this file for\r\nmore information.\r\n\r\n*License*:       This fullscreenbg plugin is in the public domain.\r\n\r\n*Repository*:    https://github.com/mhucka/jquery.fullscreenbg.js\r\n \r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis needs jQuery and the jQuery plugin \"imagesLoaded.js\" to be loaded prior\r\nto use.  (For \"imagesLoaded.js\" I use the version of commit ff65027665, date\r\n2012-02-01, from https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded .)  An explanation\r\nof how to load everything is given below.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis looks for an element with a specific id (default: `#bgimg`).  It checks\r\nthat it's an `<img>` element, and if it is, it resizes the image to the\r\ncurrent size of the window.  Optionally, it will only resize the width of the\r\nimage if the `<img>` element contains the attribute `widthOnly`.  It binds\r\nthe resizing function to the DOM \"onresize\" event handler so that the image\r\nis continually resized as the user resizes the window.\r\n\r\nNote: to avoid the image blinking when the page is first loaded, make sure to\r\n*set the image visibility to `hidden` in the CSS style*.  This code will\r\nautomatically reset visibility to `visible` when the image is actually loaded\r\nand rescaled.  (See step #5 below.)\r\n\r\nHere is an example of using this plugin in a web page:\r\n\r\n**1**. Place the file \"jquery.fullscreenbg.min.js\" in a directory where you\r\nput other Javascript files for your web pages.  The rest of these\r\ninstructions assume that your Javascript files are located in a subdirectory\r\nnamed \"js\" in the root directory of your site.\r\n\r\n**2**. If you have not already done so, download the \"imagesLoaded.js\" jQuery\r\nplugin and place it in your \"js\" directory.  (See\r\nhttps://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded for the code.)\r\n\r\n**3**. (Optional) Create a Javascript file that will serve to load all the\r\nother Javascript files for your web pages.  The rest of these instructions\r\nassume that this file is named \"main.js\".  Put the following code in\r\n\"main.js\":\r\n\r\n~~~~~javascript\r\n$.getScript('js/jquery.imagesloaded.js', function() {\r\n  $.getScript('js/jquery.fullscreenbg.min.js', function() {\r\n    jQuery.fn.fullscreenbg({ bgID: '#bgimg' });\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n~~~~~\r\n\r\n**4**. In the HTML file for each page that will contain the background image,\r\nput the following in the `<head>` element (again, assuming that you are using\r\nthe \"main.js\" approach and all your JavaScript files are in a directory named\r\n\"js\"):\r\n\r\n~~~~~HTML\r\n<script src=\"js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"js/main.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n~~~~~\r\n\r\n**5**. In that same HTML file, put an `<img>` element after your `<body>`\r\nelement that refers to the image you want on the background, and has the id\r\n`#bgimg`.  Example:\r\n\r\n~~~~~HTML\r\nDOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\">\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/style.css\" />\r\n  <script src=\"js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n  <script src=\"js/main.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n<img id=\"bgimg\" src=\"my-background-image.jpg\">\r\n  ... rest of page ...\r\n~~~~~\r\n\r\nIf the image should only be scaled to the full width of the browser window,\r\nrather than fitted in both dimensions, add the attribute `widthOnly` to the\r\n`<img>` element.  Example:\r\n\r\n~~~~~HTML\r\n<img id=\"bgimg\"src=\"another-image.jpg\" widthOnly>\r\n~~~~~\r\n\r\n**6**. In your CSS file (in this example called \"css/style.css\"), include the\r\nfollowing to define `#bgimg` with `position: absolute` and `visibility:\r\nhidden` as discussed above.\r\n\r\n~~~~~CSS\r\n#bgimg {\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  z-index:  -1;\r\n  visibility: hidden;\r\n}\r\nbody {\r\n  overflow: hidden; /* Eliminates scrollbars caused by the bkgnd image. */\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  padding: 0;\r\n  margin: 0;        /* Necessary for the raster to fill the screen. */\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n}\r\n~~~~~\r\n\r\nIf for some reason you want to use a different image identifier than\r\n`#bgimg`, then change the value set for `bgID` in the code shown in step #2,\r\nchange the value of the `<img>` element's `id` in step #5, and change the CSS\r\nidentifier `#bgimg` in step 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory and acknowledgments\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nThe method and the original code are based on \"Fullscreenr - lightweight\r\nfull screen background jquery plugin\" by Jan Schneiders, version 1.0,\r\nobtained from the web page http://nanotux.com/blog/fullscreen/ in late\r\n2011.  The original downloaded file had a modification date of Nov. 28,\r\n2009.  I contacted the author in April 2012, and obtained his permission to\r\nallow this modified version of his code to be released under the new name\r\n\"fullscreenbg\" and placed in the public domain.\r\n\r\nI generated the minified version of jquery.fullscreenbg.js using JSMin.\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nI welcome improvements of all kinds, to the code and to the documentation.\r\nPlease feel free to contact me or do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Fork this repo.  See the links at the top of the github page.\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`) and write\r\nyour changes to the code or documentation.\r\n3.
